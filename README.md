# Instruction Scheduling project for CDA5106-Advanced Computer Architecture (UCF)

Project reference - https://github.com/cececec/Dyn_Instr_Scheduling/tree/master


To Do - 
  1. Complete the Pythonic implementation - use the reference project as a guide and verification tool
  2. Use the Python implementation for the evaluation and add the report to this repo
  3. Implement the Ahead-of-Time (AoT) instruction scheduling algorithm and evaluate using this Python implementation
  4. Update this readme file to include the report and results of the algorithm. Delete this "To Do" section and the Project reference link.
  5. Make this repo public.
